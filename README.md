You should use [ember-lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-lodash)

Or, you can use [ember-browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ember-browserify) to include [lodash/lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) by including `lodash` in your `package.json` and then `import _ from "npm:lodash"` (though this doesn't support named imports)
